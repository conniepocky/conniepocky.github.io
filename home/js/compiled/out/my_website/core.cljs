My friend John Stevenson who does so much for everyone in the Clojure community and works really hard to run the Clojure study group that I attend every week is doing an amazing bicycle ride across Great Britain for charity and I hope you will take a look at their page and sponsor them please for as little or as much as you can. It will go towards making young people‚Äôs lives better all over the UK üôè

I‚Äôve been very lucky and had lots of help with my coding from John and other kind people in the community and it has made me really happy. I hope that other young people can get support to follow their dreams too with charities like The Princes Trust.

Here it is - John‚Äôs fundraising page for his 1000 miles in 9 days challenge! üö≤
