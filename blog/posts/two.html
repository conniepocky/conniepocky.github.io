        <h1>Can computers generate a truly random number?</h1>

        <p>I wanted to try write an article/essay on a topic combining both mathematics and computing. After much research I finally landed on random numbers, something which I had never really given much thought before, but as I began my research 
            I soon realised how important they really are, and how they are used in so many different areas of computing. Furthermore it led me to question what defines a random number? How can a computer generate them? What are examples of random numbers in the real world?
        </p>

        <p>I answer these questions in my article, and I hope you enjoying reading it and learn something from this article that you hadn't known before! :)</p>
