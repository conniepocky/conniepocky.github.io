        <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

        <p>Hi everyone, welcome to my first blog post :) I am hoping to use this to post articles related to computing and maths and also to document my programming journey! This post is going to be a little
            shorter than the others as it is just an introduction to my blog.</p>
        </p>
    
        <p>I just began studying my A-Levels and so far I am really enjoying them - Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Biology - and I have the goal of studying computer science at university 🖥️</p>
    
        <p>Recently I have been experimenting a lot with Machine Learning and I completed the Stanford Introduction to Machine Learning course in order to deepen my knowledge 
            in this area. I have made several projects using ML/Deep Learning including some using medical datasets that I found particulary fascinating, including one that 
            predicts whether a <a style="color: #45B5D1;" href="https://github.com/conniepocky/breast-cancer-tumour-diagnosis">breast cancer tumour is benign or malignant</a>.</p>
        </p>

        <p>As for any projects I have upcoming... I am currently working on a (super secret) iOS app which I hope to be able to reveal soon, so keep an eye out 👀😁</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading my first blog post! :)</p>
