        <h1>Flashback App - after launch</h1>

        <p>On 1st January (nearly two months ago) I launched my first iOS app to the app store - <a style="color: #45B5D1;" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flashback-share-the-moment/id6739185801">Flashback</a> after over 6 months of working on it.</p>
    
        <p>Since then it's been great to see people downloading the app and enjoying it to share memories with friends and family. So, I thought I'd make a blog post to reflect upon my app launch and think of plans for future updates!</p>

        <h2>What I felt went well?/What I was most pleased with?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Fully functional app (for now ðŸ˜…) - may sound like something obvious but it can be very common that when an app is launched you discover a previously unknown major bug! After launch there was one minor text typo in part of the app but that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Minimalistic and well designed <a style="color: #45B5D1;" href="https://flashback-website.onrender.com/">app landing page</a>. I wanted the website to be straight to the point, clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Learning new frameworks - this was my first project using Firebase for databases and I gained a lot from the experience and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was challenging at first as I was not familiar with it, but the documentation was very clear and helpful and without it the app would not be possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I would do differently?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Plan and research marketing sooner. As this was my first app I was relatively unexperienced in this area, so the time between the app trailer and landing page being released to the actual app being released was not very long.</li>
            <li>Get more people to test it and give feedback prior to launch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Whats next?</h2>

        <p>I am currently in the process of developing a new update to the app, which will improve the design/aesthetics of the app - particularly to the welcome and sign in/register screens.</p> 
            
        <p>If anyone who uses the app has any other ideas for improvement please feel free to email me (email address can be found <a style="color: #45B5D1;" href="https://conniepocky.github.io/">here</a>) :)</p>

        <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
